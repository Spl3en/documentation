How to explore this guide : 

- Are you curious why ICON matters? Start with [Introduction](#introduction).
- Are you a Smart Contract developer? Go to [SCORE](#score).
- DApp developers, you will definitely need to interact with your Smart Contract and send transactions to the ICON network from your decentralized application. Read [ICON SDKs](#icon-sdks). ICON wallet (ICONex) also exposes a couple of useful APIs to sign your transaction on your behalf. [ICONex Connect](#iconex-connect) is for that.  
- Interested in being a P-Rep? Everything about operating P-Rep node is here, [Running an ICON Node](#running-an-icon-node). 
- Curious about ICONLOOP's enterprise solution? [Enterprise Solution - loopchain](#enterprise-solution---loopchain)
- [References](#references) - Want to go deeper? A comprehensive collection of how-to guides, protocol specifications, design specifications, and user manuals. 

## Documentation Structure

ICON technical documentation is organized as follows.  

### Introduction 

If you are new to ICON, this is a good starting point. You will learn the motivation and the design goals of ICON project. We will convince you why ICON is technically differentiating from other blockchain networks.   

- **What is ICON**
- **ICON Key Concepts**: Account, transaction, transaction fees, different types of ICON nodes, parallel processing, P-Rep election, ICON incentive scoring system, and the interchain protocol are explained here. 
- **The ICON Network**: Will show how ICON network is logically structured across the world. 

### ICON Application Services

No platform is complete without supporting services. 

- **ICONest**: Token creation and Crowdsale platform.   
- **ICONex**: ICONex is a trademark of ICON official wallet application. Chrome, Android, and iOS applications are available. 
- **Tracker**: ICON block and transaction explorer. 
- **ICON ID**: Decentralized ID on the blockchain.
- **User Manuals**: Reference manuals for the detailed functions of the above applications. 

### SCORE

This is where the fun begins. Smart Contract is the core building blocks of every blockchain application. In this section, you will get everything you need to know to write, test and deploy a Smart Contract on ICON.

- **SCORE Quickstart**: No previous ICON knowledge or experience are required. As long as you are a developer and are able to play with Python, Docker, and Linux, following this guideline will lead you to deploy and run your first SCORE on the ICON testnet.
- **SCORE Development Guide**:  All the development tools and the SCORE syntax are explained here. 
- **SCORE Audit**: Please make sure you comprehend the audit checklist. This is the SCORE coding patterns that the platform mandates. 
- **Sample SCOREs**: Reference implementation and the explanation about it.

### T-Bears

T-Bears is a SCORE development suite. To write a Smart Contract on ICON, you need to install T-Bears first. T-Bears installs the `iconservice` python package which is required to write a SCORE, CLI tools to create, run, test, and deploy a SCORE, and the emulated node environment that runs on your local machine.

### ICON SDKs

ICON SDK is a library that implements the JSON-RPC v3 protocol to interact with the ICON nodes and execute the SCORE functions. ICON officially supports Java, Python, JavaScript, and Swift.

### ICONex Connect

ICONex Connect is a protocol that signs and sends a transaction on behalf of application. ICONex app will prompt a user to enter a password.


### Running an ICON node

- **P-Rep**: If you are a P-Rep or a P-Rep candidate, please read this section. This section contains all the guidelines from node installation to the troubleshooting. 
- **Citizen Node**: Sometimes you need to run your own citizen node for some reasons, i.e., security or performance. This section explains the installation and configuration of the citizen node.

### Enterprise Solution - loopchain

We will briefly mention loopchain, ICONLOOP's enterprise blockchain solution. Inter-connecting ICON mainnet with the private loopchain networks is one of ICON's big milestone. loopchain engine shares all the technical components of ICON with the addition of enterprise-specific features.
