## What is ICON

The ICON project was started to ensure the integrity of data shared between institutions and companies transparently, and to move mutual assets on heterogeneous blockchains without a centralized organization. 
ICON blockchain technology enables companies to reduce their human and financial resources in treating data and various asset management and create an unprecedented experience for users on blockchain.

### Interchain - connect heterogeneous blockchains 
The ICON Network has a structure for connecting heterogeneous blockchains operating in different domains. 

**Problem to solve**

Current blockchains are independently operating in different area and domian, however, there is no standard protocol to exchange data and assets between different blockchains.
For example, when you move the assets of security domain blockchain to insurance domain blockchain or an Etherium or ICON, it is almost impossible to transfer because there is no secure and standard way. 

Even though you use oracle relayer to transfer the asset, there remains risk of trust in the oracle centralized. To avoid the trust issue of oracle, a secure standard protocol that prevents forgery and tampering when moving assets between heterogeneous blockchains is mandatory.

**Future with Interchain**

In the 1970s, different private networks were solely operated and cut off. 
However, when TCP/IP protocol standard came out to connect private networks and formed a huge Internet network, which of power has been incredibily huge.

ICON project could create a strong interconnected blockchain network by integrating various public and enterprise networks as TCP/IP did. 
ICON interchain protocol(BTP) will begin to intergrate dApps and wallets(users) on different blockchains, have a role of bridge between heterogeneous blockchains invisibly, and penetrate deeper into our lives.

### Additional unique features of ICON
- **IISS(ICON Incentive Scoring System)** : Voting/DApp/EEP reward to encourage contribution to ICON Network  
- **Configurable Fee** : fee sharing, zero fee using virtual step
- **High Mobile Accessibility** : Mobile web, Android, iOS ( [IIP-14](https://github.com/icon-project/IIPs/blob/master/IIPS/iip-14.md) )
- **Support both Enterprise and Public Blockchain**  


## What to do with ICON

Developers can make following unique services and features with ICON network 

### Token economy and point earning system
