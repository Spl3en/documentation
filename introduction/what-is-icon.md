## What is ICON

The ICON project was started to ensure the integrity of data shared between institutions and companies transparently, and to move mutual assets on heterogeneous blockchains without a centralized organization. 
ICON blockchain technology enables companies to reduce their human and financial resources in treating data and various asset management and create an unprecedented experience for users on the blockchain.

### Interchain - connect heterogeneous blockchains 
The ICON Network has a structure for connecting heterogeneous blockchains operating in different domains. 

**Problems to solve**

Current blockchains are independently operating in different areas and domains, and there is no standard protocol to exchange data and assets between different blockchains.
For example, when you move the assets on the security domain blockchain to the insurance domain blockchain, or when you move the assets on Etherium to ICON, it is almost impossible to transfer because there is no secure and standard way of doing so. 

Even though you use an oracle relayer to transfer the asset, there remains a risk of trust in the oracle being centralized. To avoid the trust issue of the oracle, a secure standard protocol that prevents forgery and tampering when moving assets across heterogeneous blockchains was needed.

**Future with Interchain**

In the 1970s, different private networks were solely operated and they were disconnected from each other. 
However, once the TCP/IP protocol standard came out to connect private networks and formed a huge Internet, the power of the Internet has been growing huge at an incredible rate.

ICON project aims to create a strongly interconnected blockchain network by integrating various public and enterprise networks as the TCP/IP did. 
ICON interchain protocol(BTP) will begin to integrate dApps and wallets(users) on different blockchains, have a role of bridging between heterogeneous blockchains invisibly, and penetrate deeper into our lives.

### Additional unique features of ICON
- **IISS(ICON Incentive Scoring System)** : Voting/DApp/EEP reward to encourage contribution to ICON Network  
- **Configurable Fee** : fee sharing, zero fee using virtual step
- **High Mobile Accessibility** : Mobile web, Android, iOS ( [IIP-14](https://github.com/icon-project/IIPs/blob/master/IIPS/iip-14.md) )
- **Support both Enterprise and Public Blockchain**  


## What to do with ICON

Developers can make the following unique services and features with ICON network
