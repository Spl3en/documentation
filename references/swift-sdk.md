ICON supports SDK for 3rd party or user services development. You can integrate ICON SDK for your project and utilize ICONâ€™s functionality.
This document provides you with an information of installation and basic usage guideline.

Get different types of examples as follows.

| Example                                                 | Description                                                  |

| [ICX Transfer](#icx-transfer)                           | An example of transferring ICX and confirming the result.    |
| [Token Deploy and Transfer](#token-deploy-and-transfer) | An example of deploying an IRC token, transferring the token and confirming the result. |

## Prerequisite

[Enumereate any required knowledge, configuration, or resources to complete this tutorial.
Provide links to other useful resources.]
[Helping your readers to prepare increases the likelihood that they will continue reading.]

## Installation

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependecy manager for Swift Cocoa projects.

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate ICONKit into your project, specify it in your `Podfile`

```
target '<Your Target Name>' do
    use_frameworks!
    ...
    pod 'ICONKit', '~> 0.2.5'
    ...
end
```

Now install the ICONKit

```
$ pod install
```

## Configuration (Optional)

Such as env. variables 

## Using the SDK

[Import, initialize, deinitialize, and basic call that applies to every or most code to use the SDK. 
This section also serves as a test if the SDK has been correctly installed and ready to use.] 

### ICONService

APIs called through `ICONService`.

It can be initialized as follows.

```Swift
let iconService = ICONService(provider: "https://ctz.solidwallet.io/api/v3", nid: "0x1")
```

### Result

ICONKit uses [Result](https://github.com/antitypical/Result) framework. All functions of ICONService returns Result<T, ICONResult>. `T` for successor, `ICONResult` for error.
Refer to [Result](https://github.com/antitypical/Result) for more detail.

### Queries

A simple query of the block by height is as follows.

```Swift
let service = ICONService(provider: "https://ctz.solidwallet.io/api/v3", nid: "0x1")

// Gets a block matching the block height.
let request: Request<Response.Block> = service.getBlock(height: height)
let result = request.execute()

switch result {
case: .success(let responseBlock):
    ...
case: .failure(let error):
    print(error)
}
```

All queries are requested by a `Request<T>`.

Its requests are executed as **Synchronized**.
(*will supports asynchronized version soon.*)

```Swift
let response = service.getBlock(height: height).execute()

switch response {
case: .success(let responseBlock):
    ...
case: .failure(let error):
    print(error)
}
```

The querying APIs are as follows.

```Swift
// Gets the block
let request:  = service.getBlock(height: height)
let request: Request<Response.Block> = service.getBlock(hash: "0x000...000")
let request: Request<Response.Block> = service.getLastBlock()

// Gets the balance of an given account
let request: Request<Response.IntValue> = service.getBalance(address: "hx000...1")

// Gets a list of ScoreAPI
let request: Request<Response.ScoreAPI> = service.getScoreAPI(scoreAddress: "cx000...1")

// Gets the total supply of ICX
let request: Request<Response.IntValue> = service.getTotalSupply()

// Gets a transaction matching the given transaction hash
let request: Request<Response.Transaction> = service.getTransaction(hash: "0x000...000")

// Gets the result of the transaction matching the given transaction hash
let request: Request<Response.TransactionResult> = service.getTransactionResult(hash: "0x000...000")

// Calls a SCORE API just for reading
let call = Call(from: wallet.address, to: scoreAddress, method: "balanceOf", params: params)
let request: Request<Response.IntValue> = service.call(call)
```

### Transactions 

Calling SCORE APIs to change states is requested as sending a transaction.

Before sending a transaction, the transaction should be signed.

**Loading wallets and storing the Keystore**

```Swift
// Generates a wallet.
let wallet = Wallet(privateKey: nil)

// OR

// Load a wallet from the private key.
let privateKey = PrivateKey(hexData: data)
let wallet = Wallet(privateKey: privateKey)
```

**Creating transactions**

```Swift
// Sending ICX
let transaction = Transaction()
    .from(wallet.address)
    .to(to)
    .value(BigUInt(15000000))
    .stepLimit(BigUInt(1000000))
    .nonce("0x1")
    .nid(service.nid)

// Call
let transaction = Transaction()
    .from(wallet.address)
    .to(scoreAddress)
    .stepLimit(BigUInt(1000000))
    .call("transfer")
    .nonce("0x1")
    .nid(service.nid)
    .params(["_to": to, "_value": "0x1234"])

// Message
let transaction = Transaction()
    .from(wallet.address)
    .to(to)
    .value(BigUInt(15000000))
    .stepLimit(BigUInt(1000000))
    .message("Hello, World!")
    .nonce("0x1")
    .nid(service.nid)
```

`SignedTransaction` object signs a transaction using the wallet.

```Swift
do {
    let signed = try SignedTransaction(transaction: transaction, privateKey: privateKey)

    let request: Request<Response.TxHash> = service.sendTransaction(signedTransaction: signed)
    let response = request.execute()
    switch response {
    case .success(let result):
        print("tx result - \(result)")

    case .failure(let error):
        // Error handling
        print("error")
    }
    ...
} catch {
    print(error)
    ...
}
```
